## Team Roles

### Business Analyst (BA):

A Business Analyst (BA) acts as a bridge between customers and development teams. They analyze business processes, gather stakeholder feedback, and translate customer needs into clear, actionable requirements. By aligning customer vision with product development, the BA ensures the software delivers maximum business value. Their involvement often starts before the team structure is defined and continues throughout the development process, guiding both business and technical perspectives.


### Product Owner (PO):

A Product Owner (PO) is the key decision-maker responsible for a product’s vision, strategy, and evolution. They balance business needs with market trends, manage the product backlog, and ensure the final product meets customer requirements. Closely tied to Agile environments, POs focus on customer satisfaction and business goals without delving into technical implementation details.


### Project Manager (PM):

A Project Manager (PM) ensures that a product—or parts of it—is delivered on time, within budget, and with the expected quality. They manage, organize, and motivate the development team while tracking progress and aligning work with stakeholder goals. In traditional (sequential) models, PMs plan, assign tasks, and monitor project status. In Agile settings, PMs emphasize transparency, communication, continuous improvement, and value delivery. While sometimes seen as unnecessary in Agile environments with roles like scrum masters, PMs become essential when overseeing multiple projects, as they bridge high-level business needs with day-to-day execution.


### UI/UX Designer:

A UI/UX Designer transforms product vision into user-friendly, engaging, and effective designs. The UX (User Experience) side focuses on the entire user journey—research, personas, information architecture, wireframing, and prototyping—to ensure smooth and meaningful interactions. The UI (User Interface) side creates intuitive, visually appealing, and easy-to-use interfaces. Together, UI/UX design ensures a product not only looks good but also delivers an enjoyable and efficient experience, boosting both user satisfaction and business results. Designers stay involved throughout the product lifecycle, continuously refining and improving the user experience.


### Software Architect role:

A Software Architect is a senior engineer responsible for designing high-level software architecture and making critical technical decisions. They choose the right tools, frameworks, and platforms to bring the product vision to life, set coding standards, and perform code reviews. Architects define how different services, databases, and integrations should work together while ensuring system security, scalability, and stability. Their role is especially vital for complex products or legacy systems requiring major structural changes.


### Software Architect

A Software Architect is a senior engineer who designs high-level software architecture and makes key technical decisions. They select appropriate tools, frameworks, and platforms to realize the product vision, establish coding standards, and conduct code reviews. Architects determine how services, databases, and integrations interact while ensuring security, scalability, and stability. Their expertise is especially critical in complex systems or when modernizing legacy software.


### Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer

A QA Engineer ensures that an application performs according to both functional (what the system does) and non-functional (how it performs) requirements. They run and analyze different types of tests—covering functionality, usability, security, and performance—to identify defects and verify product quality. QA specialists also create and maintain testing documentation such as test scenarios, protocols, and reports. Experienced QA engineers go beyond testing by designing quality assurance processes that prevent defects and ensure higher reliability throughout development.


### Test Automation Engineer

A Test Automation Engineer builds and maintains automated testing frameworks to accelerate and improve software testing. They design test automation ecosystems, write and maintain scripts, and provide continuous, reliable feedback on application quality without human intervention. Skilled professionals determine which parts of an application should be automated versus tested manually, ensuring that automation remains cost-effective, maintainable, and high-value throughout the product lifecycle.


### DevOps Engineer

A DevOps Engineer bridges the gap between development and operations teams by automating and streamlining the software delivery process. They design and maintain CI/CD pipelines to enable faster, more reliable releases while ensuring application stability. Collaborating with developers, system administrators, and operations staff, DevOps engineers oversee deployments, unify workflows, and create a culture of shared responsibility for continuous delivery and system performance.
